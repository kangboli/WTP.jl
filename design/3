* Goals and Non-Goals

The goal is to provide a /thin layer of abstractions/ for
manipulating periodic lattices and electron orbitals.

=WTP= is thin in that only tries to get a few basic yet tricky things right, and
it refuses to do anything on top of that such as energy calculation. The target
audience of =WTP= is method developers, who may want to have the difficult but
unpublishable details dealt with but nothing more. A more traditional =code= may
very well have some of the functionalities of =WTP= implemented in some shape or
form, but to use them one has to write ones program as part of another =code= or
distribution, the entirety of which becomes an implicit dependency. This is an
awful idea as it leads to quadratic scaling in terms of developer time,
compilation time, and perhaps community management.

To reiterate, the goal is not to build a powerful electronic structure =code= of
any sort.
